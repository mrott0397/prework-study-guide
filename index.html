        <h2> HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up pf elemts which work together to provide content</li>
          <li>HTML elements are usually composed of an opening and closing tag, represented with angle brackets</li>
          <li>Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage</li>
          <li>All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body element</li>
          <li>DOCTYPE html is the Decloration at the top. This decloration tells the browser what document type it should expect when opened</li>
          <li>html elements are case sensitive</li>
          <li>"html lang="en" is the start of the document and telling the broswer the language is English (en) This is an attribute</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element. HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, not the closing element</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author and viewport</li>
          <li>"meta charset= "UTF-8" The meta elemt defines the charset, or character set, as UTF-8, which allows us to use most characters and symbols</li>
          <li>The title element sets the title of the webpage</li>
          <li>An HTML develepor is not only responsible for providing the structure for thr webpage, but also making sure that it provides a positive user experience</li>
          <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called CHILD ELEMENTS. If there are other elements nested inside of a body element, those three nested elements are known as child elements</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children elements, is the PARENT ELEMENT</li>
          <li>In Semantic HTML Elements, the name of the element describes the content and the roll it plays in a webpage</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The ul element represents Unordered Lists</li>
          <li>The ol element represents Ordered Lists</li>
          <li>The li element represents List Items</li>
          <li>The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or line break</li>
          <li>The a element (which stabds for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or others. The href attribute points to the url for the link</li>
          <li>The alt attribute contains a text string that describes the apperance and functionality of the image. The alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search engine rankings</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copywrite, contacts, site map, and navigation</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
          <li>An important takeaway is that we can use semantic HTML elements to indicate the roll of their content, as well as to give structure to the content</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To add style to your webpage, you use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which is a programming language used by developers to define how the webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and orginization</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use Inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>Inline styles are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible  than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>An ecample of inline css is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading: h1 style= "color:red;"</li>
          <li>It is possible to embed an entire style sheet directly into the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and ID's.</li>
          <li>A single change to the CSS rule with apply to all the tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by usiong an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is preffered in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>Seperation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to seperating code into different filed based on use. This is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: 1. The CSS property we want to apply 2. Value of the property. For example: The declaration color:blue; includes the CSS property COLOR and the value for that property, BLUE.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word proccesing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer</li>
          <li>When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space.</li>
          <li>The padding property adds a space around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you make the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>*: To apply rule to all visible elements.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>text-align: One way to center a title or heading.</li>
          <li>display:block; : the display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each iage to start a new line.</li>
          <li>fontsize</li>
          <li>Add CSS file to head section with meta.</li>
          <li>rel: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document source.</li>
          <li>href: Specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. href is using a relative path, this means the location is derived fromm the current location.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attributes can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <li>Class selector: .card</li>
          <li>.card: The peroid preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, will gaine the property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element frame. You can set multiple effects seperated by commas.</li>
          <li>A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur, and spread radius, and color.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including, by semantic refrences such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A Variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
          <li>Browser Application Programming INterfaces (API's) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; Collecting and manipulating a video strea from a users webcvam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
          <li>Third-party API's that allow developers to incorperate functionality in sites fromo other content providers such as Twitter and Facebook.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable name. This name must be unique because it is how we will refrence the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. Example: var shape = "circle"</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by qoutation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon</li>
          <li>console.log: We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>console.log(topics);  : In this case, console.log will output the value of topics to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses</li>
          <li>The word console refers to a test environment thats used to check out a code. .log is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom.</li>
          <li>An if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets conditions, or is true.</li>
          <li>When the computer encounters an if statement in a JavaScript file, it will check to see if the condition that we provide is truthy. If it is, then it will do whatever action we ask it to do in between the curly brackets. If the condition isn't true or has a value that isn't truthy, then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition by using else if.</li>
          <li>The computer will continue through all of the conditions that we list, evaluating whether or not a condition is truthy. Once it finds a condition that is truthy, it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, and then break out of the if statement</li>
          <li>=== : the strict equality operator checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if they are equal and false if they are not</li>
          <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>The following variable declaration demonstrates how we would represent our group of shapes in an array named shapes: var shapes = ["triangle", "pentagon", "square", "circle"];</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>Following example has info about a student named Lu; name age, and whether he is enrolled: var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true]; Lu is a string, needs quotation marks, 54 is a number, true i a Boolean value</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement</li>
          <li>By using the for loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes (items) in our array and log them to the console until there are none left.</li>
          <li>In order to use the for loop, we need the shapes(item) index and the arrays length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array.</li>
          <li>We can find the length of the array by using a built-in property of an array, named length.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following thre important statements: 1.The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code: var x = 0; 2.The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown: x < shapes.length; 3.The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices is what allow the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut for x+1 Now everytime the code loops, x will increase by 1.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it: /* before block of code and */ after.</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable. Then we will give the function a unique name and use that whenever we call the function.</li>
          <li>A functions name is followed by parentheses ()</li>
          <li>Math functions selects a random number.</li>
