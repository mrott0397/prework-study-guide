# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

I built this webpage to have all of my notes from my prework organized and in one place so that they are easy to use. I did this in order to be succesful within my Coding Bootcamp. It solves the problem of having to flip from page to page in my notebook, where I handwrite my notes. It makes it much easy to study and refrence from when I can see everything in one place. I learned abouit HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

## Usage

Each of the sections within my webpage contains a main topic that we learnd about in the prework. The main topics are HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript. When you open the DevTools console, you can see JavaScript runnning. It will lists the topics we learned from the prework and randomly choose as topic for us to study first.
